   <H1>SEO ASSIGNMENT</H1>
   <P>Question 1 </P>
   <p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the art and science of getting pages to rank higher in search engines such as Google. Because search is one of the main ways in which people discover content online, ranking higher in search engines can lead to an increase in traffic to a website.</p>
   <p>Example</p>
   <p>
    If you search for “best dog food,” you don’t want to see articles about different types of dog diets or recipes for homemade dog food. Both would be topically relevant, but they do not fulfill your search intent. 

Google knows, based on the behavior of millions of other users, that if you search for “best dog food,” you almost certainly want to buy dog food. 

That’s why Google ranks either product pages or reviews of the best dog food products (i.e., the search intent is either transactional or commercial).
